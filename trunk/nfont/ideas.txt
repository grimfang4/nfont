*drawColumn()  // no height limit
*Make NFont own the surfaces passed to it.  No freeSurface() needed.
*Change baseline to Uint16

Make drawBox() do the right thing.
Replace SDL_Colors with NFont::Color.
Simplify animation data?
Load other bitmap font layouts?
Make boxed drawing awesome.
Remove "extended ASCII".
Add real UTF-8.  Maybe not simple with a bitmap storage...  Needs to know which glyphs to create from ttf.  Needs to know how to load glyphs from bitmap (i.e. glyph string "ABC...").
Update docs.

drawFn(screen, x, y, fn, text, ...)



void optimizeForVideoSurface()
{
	SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha();
