*Add alignment to drawBox().

Add animation parameters: AnimData::frequencyX, AnimData::frequencyY, AnimData::amplitudeX, AnimData::amplitudeY
Make drawBox() use rect union with the existing clip rect.
Bump to v3.0.0
Update docs.

Load other bitmap font layouts?
Remove "extended ASCII".
Add real UTF-8.  Maybe not simple with a bitmap storage...  Needs to know which glyphs to create from ttf.  Needs to know how to load glyphs from bitmap (i.e. glyph string "ABC...").
