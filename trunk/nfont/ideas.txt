*Change widths and heights to Uint16.
*getColumnHeight()

Replace SDL_Colors with NFont::Color.
Make NFont own the surfaces passed to it.  No freeSurface() needed.
Simplify animation data?
Load other bitmap font layouts?
Make boxed drawing awesome.
Remove "extended ASCII".
Add real UTF-8.  Maybe not simple with a bitmap storage...  Needs to know which glyphs to create from ttf.  Needs to know how to load glyphs from bitmap (i.e. glyph string "ABC...").
Update docs.

drawFn(screen, x, y, fn, text, ...)

drawColumn()  // no height limit
drawBox()


void optimizeForVideoSurface()
{
	SDL_DisplayFormatAlpha();
}
