NFont v4.0.0: A font class for SDL
by Jonathan Dearborn
[code.google.com/p/nfont]
Dedicated to the memory of Florian Hufsky


Requires:
    SDL ("SDL.h") [www.libsdl.org]
    SDL_gpu ("SDL_gpu.h") [code.google.com/p/sdl-gpu] - Not required by NFontR
    SDL_ttf ("SDL_ttf.h") [www.libsdl.org] - Can be disabled, see below

Notes:
    NFont is a font class with text-block alignment, full
    support for the newline character ('\n'), position animation,
    and UTF-8 support.
	
	There are two versions of NFont.  NFont uses SDL_gpu for rendering.  An
	alternative, NFontR, uses SDL 2.0's built-in SDL_Renderer API.  To use
	NFontR, use the NFont.h header in the NFontR directory.
    
    NFont natively loads SFont bitmaps and TrueType fonts with SDL_ttf.  The 
    standard bitmaps have the following characters (ASCII 33-126) separated by 
    pink (255, 0, 255) pixels in the topmost row:
    ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~
    
    Define NFONT_NO_TTF before including NFont.h (or project-wide) to disable TrueType fonts.

    If you come up with something cool using NFont, I'd love to hear about it.
